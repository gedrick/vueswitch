# VueSwitch

# What Is This?

Put simply this is a Switch system in straight CSS that has been broken up into
a Vue project. It can be used for any purpose. Firstly, credit where credit is due.


The original design was created in full by [Mike Mangialardi](https://codepen.io/mikemang/), all I could find was [his CodePen page](https://codepen.io/mikemang/pen/JEqgeO) where the fiddle was hosted. I was working on a little fun side project and needed a Switch design, and his was the most versatile. So, thanks Mike!

It was disassembled and mostly rewritten to respect BEM naming convention standards, as well as breaking each part into a component and adding key tracking. It's not great but it's a decent scaffolding.
